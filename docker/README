Docker definitions for the bin builder.
Everything is based on abyss (and requires a working abyssos/abyss:latest copy, get that separately).
Exception: rust is based on the official rust image (debian); this is because rust is shit and unironically works better when you cross compile (as opposed to build natively for musl).

Run ./docker.sh in this directory once you have a working abyssos/abyss:latest and you will get:
- binbuilder:c
- binbuilder:go
- binbuilder:rust
